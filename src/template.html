        <h1>ABOUT DE KAS</h1>
        <h3>HARVESTED IN THE MORNING, ON YOUR PLATE IN THE AFTERNOON.</h3>
        <p>We’ve been working with this philosophy, from plant to plate, since 2001. It’s in our DNA. Our gardens in Amsterdam and
        the Beemster are the heart and soul of our restaurant and our menu. They reflect the changing seasons and never fail to
        surprise.
        In our gardens – greenhouse and open air – we grow around 300 varieties of vegetables, herbs and fruits. Harvested at
        the very last minute and prepared in the kitchen as quickly as possible.</p>

        <h1>HOW IT STARTED</h1>
        <h3>RESTAURANT DE KAS IS TUCKED AWAY IN THE AMSTERDAM PARK FRANKENDAEL IN EAST AMSTERDAM.</h3>
        <p>In 1927, a greenhouse was built here to supply other parks in the city with trees, grasses, and exotic plants. However,
        by the end of the 20th century, the greenhouse had become obsolete due to declining demand. It seemed destined for
        demolition until in 2000, the nursery found a new purpose when it was converted into a restaurant. Now, guests dine in
        the midst of the greenhouse, under the starry sky, overlooking the garden where vegetables and herbs are grown.
        Therefore, De Kas became one of the world's first farm-to-table restaurants.</p>
