# Restaurant-Page
A dynamically rendered restaurant homepage built to practice DOM manipulation, ES6 Modules, and Webpack. The entire content of the page is generated using JavaScript, with no hard-coded HTML in the main content div.

Features

    Tabbed Navigation: Users can switch between "Home," "Menu," and "Contact" tabs without reloading the page.

    Modular Architecture: Each tab constitutes a separate JavaScript module.

    Webpack Bundling: Uses Webpack to bundle assets and JavaScript files.
